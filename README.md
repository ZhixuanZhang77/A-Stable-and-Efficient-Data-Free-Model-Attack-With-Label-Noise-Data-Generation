We have shared some key codes about this work. 
Welcome to compare and cite our work. Thanks!

Some tips you may pay attetion:
* Our query computation is: query = batch *epoch, which follows [29] and [39]. Because the query result of the generated data to victim model can be seemed to always store in memory in Stage1, the query of the generated data to victim model again won't increase query counts.  

* The running detail can be referred in our paper.
